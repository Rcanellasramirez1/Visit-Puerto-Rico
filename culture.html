            <h1>Music on the island</h1>
            <img id="singers" src="images/singers puerto ric.jpg">
            <p2>Puerto Rico has raised some of the most popular celebrities in the world today including: Marc Anothony, Bad Bunny, Jennifer Gonzales, Frankie Ruiz, Daddy Yankee and many more.</p2>
              <h3>Music</h3><br>
                <p1>Apart from Puerto Rico’s delicious food, beautiful sites, and world-renowned breweries and distilleries, there is a much more important aspect to Puerto Rican culture. That is music, all through the island you will constantly hear music, that being in a bar, a lobby, a supermarket, a restaurant, or walking down a street you will always hear a Puerto Rican artist playing. Puerto Ricans take pride in their music and artists as many of the most famous artists in almost every popular genre are from Puerto Rico. The most popular genres in Puerto Rico are Salsa, Bomba y Plena, Trap, and the most popular Reggaeton.</p1>
                <br><br>
                <ol><li>Salsa</li><br>
                <p1>Although being born in Cuba, after the exodus of Cubans after the revolution, Salsa reached Puerto Ricans both on the island and New York, during the Puerto Rican diaspora. The first prominent Salsa group was El Gran Combo but many artists came first such as Hector Lavoe and Tito Puente. This group and artists made the first step towards establishing Salsa as a prominent genre from the ’60s to today. El Gran Combo is still playing altogether to this day, under the record label Rimas Music. This establishment made way for other talents such as Frankie Ruiz, Victor Manuelle, and Gilberto Santa Rosa, these modern artists made Puerto Rican Salsa known across the globe breaking barriers for many young artists on the island. Although today young salsa artists are barely seen as they all want to sing Reggaeton and Trap the most prominent genre on the island.</p1><br>
            <br>
              <li>Bomba y Plena</li><br>
                <p1>This genre is the most cultural type of music on this list, mostly listened to at Christmas time, but you can sometimes hear it playing around in certain places around the island. Origins of Bomba y Plena go back to Colonial times where many Tainos (Natives) still lived on the island. This music was the way they told stories to the tribe or the way they prepared for battle with the Spanish. Many of the artists that dedicate themselves to this genre play in cultural festivals and go house by house in Christmas playing their music bringing Christmas joy along with them. Today, there is only one band that uses Bomba y Plena in their music which is La Tribu de Abrante, a well-known group on the island from Loiza. They have made Bomba y Plena popular amongst the young in Puerto Rico.</p1><br><br>   
                <li>Reggeaton</li><br>
                <p1>This genre is the one Puerto Rico is currently best known for as from the late 1990s till today the world has adopted this genre as a mainstream genre. Reggaeton is a mix of Bomb y Plena with hip hop, which mixes Puerto Rico’s African roots with modern hip hop. In its early begginings, there were three artists which opened the door for all those that followed, they were Hector “El Father” Delgado, Daddy Yankee, and Nicky Jam. From their early beginnings they had already made hits such as Gasolina, Dejale Caer To’ el Peso, and Chambonea. After these three individuals began to become famous many other artists began to rise as well, the most popular being Don Omar, De la Gheto, Arcangel, and Cosculluela. What made their music famous was the fact that they included many aspects of life in Puerto Rico into their songs making them popular amongst the masses. </p1><br><br>
