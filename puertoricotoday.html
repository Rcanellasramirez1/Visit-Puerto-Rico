          <ol><li>Food</li><br>
            <p1>This maybe one of the most underrated aspects of a visit to Puerto Rico. Many believe that what will captivate them are the landscapes and historical sites but, the food in Puerto Rico is very unique as it is composed of Spanish, English and Indigenous aspects. Making Puerto Rican food very different to many foods from around the world, a particular aspect of food on the island is the amount of grease used to cook. This makes many of the dished very unhealthy but extremely delicious. In Puerto Rico’s website there is a quote from a tourist describing his first experience on the island and he states, “Heaping portions of crispy, garlicky, fried plantains; slow-roasted, succulent pork; savory rice and beans chased with a cold local beer or fruity rum cocktail, and that's just your first meal.”</p1>
            <br><br>
            <li>Sites</li><br>
            <p1>The sites to be seen in Puerto Rico are one in a million, there are many locations in Puerto Rico that many would have to travel to different parts of the world to see but in Puerto Rico you can see them all in the island.
